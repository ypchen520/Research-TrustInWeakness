# Criteria
* Most of the images are in-the-wild scenes
* Both easy and hard images are included. But there should be more hard ones, which means the litter in the scene is not easy to detect at first glance
* The scenes include: grass, woods, roads, pond, and beaches

images.json has the class labels (courtesy of Brett's code: JSONtoBetterJSON.py)
See jsonToCsv.py for a csv friendlier view of the image labels by class.
